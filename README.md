# Serverless TODO

A simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework, developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree.

# Functionality of the application

This application allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.
